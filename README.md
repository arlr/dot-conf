# Dot conf

Folder to carry crafted configuration file for software that I use time to time or all the time.

Those files can be added to `~/.config/{softname}/`
**tmux** and **vim** needs their config file in the home directory

ÔÅ± Note of interest: 
Some of them use Nerd font to display symbols.
